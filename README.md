An Apple Script created by internet stranger John Gersh for me, to add custom magnets to an OmniGraffle object.

To use: Select a shape in Omnigraffle, then run this script from outside the application. A dialogue box within Omnigraffle will pop up that says "Which side? N, S, E, W." Select a side. The next window reads "How many Magnets?" Select the number of Magnets. And magically, your shape will have that many magnets on that edge, evenly spaced out, not including the corners. 

Note: Make sure you don't have any magnets on your shape when you first start.
